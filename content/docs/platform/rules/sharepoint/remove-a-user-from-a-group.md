title: "Remove a user from a group"

This rule allows you to remove a user from a SharePoint group using Kianda.

### When to use

This rule should be used when a user within Kianda should be removed from a SharePoint Group, for example, an employee leaving a company and to ensure they are removed from team groups.

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

### How to use

To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the list to be located. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with **Data sources** under **Administration**. 

1. Select the field or other item to attach the rule to.

2. Click on **Add a rule** > **SharePoint** > **Remove a user from a group**.

3. 3. In the **Edit rule - Remove a user from a group** dialog box, give the rule a **Title**. Then select a SharePoint data source from the drop-down list.

4. Two new fields will appear: **Username** and **Group name**. These are used to confirm the user which is to be removed and the group they are to be removed from. 
   For **Group title** **field**, select the field where the group title is stored for example, a list field.
   For **Username or User Id**, select the field where the Username or User id is stored.

5. Once these fields are set you can also set conditions for the rule, see [Conditions](/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/) for more information. 

6. The final two sections are optional: **On success mapping** and **Error mapping**. See [Success and Error Mapping](/docs/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/) for more information. 

7. Click on **OK** when complete.
