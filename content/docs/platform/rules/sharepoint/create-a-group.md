This rule allows you to create a SharePoint group from within Kianda.

### When to use

This rule should be used when you want to create a new SharePoint group from within your Kianda process for example as part of a new project you want to create a group in SharePoint to provide permissions to specific users.

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)


### How to use

To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the list to be located. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with **Data sources** under **Administration**. 

1. Select the field or other item to attach the rule to.

2. Click on **Add a rule** > **SharePoint** > **Create a group**.

3. In the **Edit rule - Create a group** dialog box, give the rule a **Title**. Then select a SharePoint data source from the drop-down list.

4. Two new fields will appear to allow you to confirm group details: 
   For **Group title** field, select the field where the group title is stored for example,  a list field.
   For **Group Description field**, create a description for the group. 

5. Once these fields are set you can also set conditions for the rule, see [Conditions](/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/) for more information. 

6. The final two sections are optional: **On success mapping** and **Error mapping**. See [Success and Error Mapping](/docs/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/) for more information. 

7. Click on **OK** when complete.
