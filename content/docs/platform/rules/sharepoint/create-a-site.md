This rule allows you to create a SharePoint site from within Kianda.

### When to use

This rule should be used when within your Kianda process you wish to create a new SharePoint site, for example, as part of a new project you want to create a site in SharePoint to store information pertaining to that project, to include all lists and other documentation that you need. 

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)

 

### How to use

To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the list to be located. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with **Data sources** under **Administration**. 

1. Select a field or other item to attach the rule to.
2. Click on **Add a rule** > **SharePoint** > **Create a site**.
3. In the **Edit rule - Create a site** dialog box, give the rule a **Title**. Then select a SharePoint data source from the drop-down list.

4. You will be presented with five options within the dialog box:
   - **Site template** allows you to select an existing SharePoint site within the SharePoint data source to emulate the formatting and design of the site.
   - **Site title field** will be used to create the name of the site. **Site title field**, **site URL**, and **site description field** are all derived from the Kianda form. Choose a field from a Kianda form.
   - **Site url field** will be used in the creation of the URL within SharePoint. Choose a field from a Kianda form.
   - **Site description field** will be used for the SharePoint site description. Choose a field from a Kianda form.
   - **Inherit parent permissions** - options are: **Yes** and **No**. If you choose 'Yes' it will allow your new site to inherit parent permissions for that SharePoint location.
5. Once these fields are set you can also set conditions on the rule, further details on conditions can be found here.
6. The final two sections are optional:

​		Under **On success mapping**, click on **Add mapping**. 
​			For **Form Field**, select a field to store the text. 
​			For **Data source field** or text, either enter the text or 
​			select a field where the text is stored.

​		Under **On error mapping**, click on **Add mapping**. 
​			For **Form Field**, select a field to store the text. 
​			For **Error message** or text, either enter the text or 
​			select a field where the text is stored.

6. Click on **OK** when complete.

7. Move the rule in the right-hand pane under **Rules** to change the order of execution as necessary.
