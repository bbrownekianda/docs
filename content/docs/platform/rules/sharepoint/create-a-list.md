This rule allows you to create a SharePoint List from within Kianda.

### When to use

This rule should be used when within your Kianda process you wish to create a new SharePoint list, for example as part of a new project you want to create a list in SharePoint to store information pertaining to that project such as invoice numbers.

You can add this rule:

- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)


### How to use

To apply this rule, first choose an item to attach the rule to and have a SharePoint data source ready where you want the list to be located. This data source should be a predefined data connector created with **Data sources** under **Administration**. 

1. Select a field or other item to attach the rule to.

2. Click on **Add a rule** > **SharePoint** > **Create a list**. 

3. In the **Edit rule - Create a list** dialog box, give the rule a **Title**. Then select a SharePoint data source from the drop-down list.

4. You will be presented with five options within the dialog box:

   - **List template** allows you to select an existing SharePoint list within the SharePoint data source to emulate the formatting and design of the list. 
   - **List name field** allows you to create a name for the list. This field, **List url field** and **List description field** are all populated from a Kianda form. Choose a field from a Kianda form.
   - **List url field** will be used in the creation of the URL within SharePoint. Choose a field from a Kianda form.
   - **List description field** will be used for the SharePoint list description. Choose a field from a Kianda form.
   - **Quick Launch menu** - options are **Yes** or **No**.

5. Once these fields are set you can also set conditions for the rule, see [Conditions](/docs/platform/rules/general/add-conditions/) for more information.

6. The final two sections are optional: : **On success mapping** and **Error mapping**. See [Success and Error Mapping](/docs/platform/rules/general/success-error-mapping/) for more information. 

7. Click on **OK** when complete.
