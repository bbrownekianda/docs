This rule works exactly like Update item rule. To delete an item from your data connection, you could use a data source filter and map data source field or text from a data connection to Kianda form field.
Use this rule together with a datasource to perform a delete query and return data identifiers for use with the form. Employ the transactional nature of the rule fields, results and error nodes to build retry logic"
