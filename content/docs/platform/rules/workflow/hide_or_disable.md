## When to use

You can add this rule:
- [x] to a field
- [x] to a form 
- [x] to a process (the rule will run on load)

## How to use

To dynamically *hide* a field or component:
1. Choose a field.  
2. Select Add a rule > Workflow > Hide or disable.
3. Click on Edit condition and add a condition.
4. Under Action, select a field or component to be made not visible.
5. Choose Hide from the drop down list.
6. Under Add otherwise action, select the field or component to be made visible.
7. Choose Show from the drop down list.
6. Click OK.

The result is that a field or component will be made visible/not visible depending on the condition that has been set.

## Notes

It is not necessary to add a condition.  In this case the rule will be triggered automatically:  
- if the rule is applied to a *field*, then the rule will be triggered when the user enters a value in that field.  
- if the rule is applied to a *button*, then the rule will be triggered when the user clicks the button.
- if the rule is applied to a *form*, then the rule will be triggered when the form is submitted.
- if the rule is applied to a *process*, then the rule will be triggered on load.

If a rule causes a mandatory field (i.e. *Required* is ticked in the Field Properties) to be hidden or disabled, this will not stop the form from being submitted.
