There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.

- **Reliable** - Apps keep working with or without network access. Even when your users are going through a tunnel or in a lift, changes are automatically queued offline and then synchronised when connectivity is restored.
- **Fast** - App loads quickly thanks to having the app installed locally, app resources are available offline.
- **Engaging** - When installing on your home screen with your brand icons users receive timely push notifications that help them stay engaged.

## Installing your PWA on a mobile

There are a few options to install your Kianda PWA workspace into mobile devices. The quickest is to let your users manually use the option "Add to home screen" in their mobile devices.

3. On the "Add to Home Screen" tap "Add".

## Offline or online

As we know in some cases, when there is no internet connection, websites are completely constrained to be shown appropriately. On the other hand, progressive web applications are regularly independent, enabling users to browse the app when not online, this increases engagement and availability greatly. With an offline mode, any information can be saved automatically during the last online access.

Emphasize benefits to potential clients who are frequently operating in remote areas with no access to the internet.

## Performance

Progressive web apps are faster because of the way the underlying technology caches and serves text, stylesheets, images and other content on the websites. As a result user experience, consistency and conversion rate increase.

Progressive web apps utilize service workers, which are JavaScript files that run independently from the main browser thread and efficiently control caching, this is how progressive web apps enhance better performance than traditional web apps.
