Low-code development offers **software developers** a shortcut to create something new and beneficial for their organisation. Rather than having to think about every single line of code, as a developer you can take advantage of Kianda's **Developer** section to create your own custom widgets from predefined field, rule and dashboard code.

You can also quickly use Kianda **Developer** to add [webhooks](#webhooks), providing an efficient way to push GET requests to other applications in real-time as the Kianda process runs and avoiding the need to poll for data. 

Kianda uses EmberJS to build widgets, and in particular the Handlebars templating library, to power the application's user interface. See [templating basics](#emberjs-templating-basics) to get started.



## EmberJS templating basics

With Handlebars you can quickly build web applications that are made up of different components. Handlebar templates contain static HTML and dynamic content inside Handlebars expressions, which are summoned with double curly braces: {{ }}

Dynamic content inside a Handlebars expression is rendered with data-binding. This means if you update a property, your usage of that property in a template will be automatically updated to the latest value.

### Helpers 

Ember gives the ability to write your helpers, to bring a minimum of logic into Ember templating. For example, let's say you would like the ability to add a few numbers together, without needing to define a computed property everywhere you would like to do so.

***Helper example***

#### Conditionals

Statements like **if** and **unless** are implemented as built-in helpers. Helpers can be invoked three ways; inline invocation, nested invocation and block invocation. For more details, go to: https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.18.0/templates/conditionals/.



## How to get started as a Kianda low-code developer

Kianda **Developer** is a user-friendly interface that allows you to create custom widgets in a few minutes. A custom widget could be a 'Field', 'Rule' or Dashboard widget'. This video goes through an example of how to create a custom field widget.

    </source>
</video>



To create custom widgets:

1. Go to the **Side menu** > **Administration** > **Developer**

2. Click on **New widget**.

3. Fill out the **Edit widget** dialog box - that is **Title**, **Unique Id** (which is autofilled from the title), **Widget Icon**, where you can select from hundreds of icons, and then **Widget type**. There are 3 options: **[Field](#field-widget)**, **[Rule](#rule-widget)** or **[Dashboard widget](#dashboard-widget)** - click on each link for more details.

4. Click on **OK** when complete.

5. Widgets created are visible in the main widget view. From here, you can edit a widget by clicking on the **Edit** button  ![Pen button](/images/bluepen.png) (Pen icon), delete a widget by clicking on the **Bin/Trash** button ![Bin button](/images/binicon.png) and restore earlier versions of a widget by clicking on the **Version restore** button ![Restore](/images/bluerestore.png).

   ***Widget view***

6. [Webhooks](#webhooks) can be created to send a message to a specific URL by clicking on the **Webhooks** button. Click the link for more information.

   

### Field widget

When you create a custom field widget, the **Widget UI** and **Widget Code** tabs are displayed. These two screenshots show the default code for 'Widget UI' and 'Widget Code'.

The 'Widget UI' defines the HTML, handlers, expressions and more.

The 'Widget Code' defines the logic and functions.

Custom field widgets you create will be available for use in Kianda Designer by going to **Side menu** > **Administration** > **Designer** > **click on an existing process** or **Add new** to add a new process (then click on a form to edit it), and see the Custom fields added under **Controls**.

### Rule widget

When you create a custom rule widget, the **Widget UI** and **Widget Code** tabs are displayed. These two screenshots show the default code for 'Widget UI' and 'Widget Code'. 
The 'Widget UI' defines the HTML, handlers, expressions and values for rules. 

***Rule widget UI***

***Rule widget code***

The 'Widget Code' defines the logic, functions and variable routines.

### Dashboard widget

When you create a custom dashboard widget, the **Widget UI** and **Widget Code** tabs are displayed. These two screenshots show the default code for 'Widget UI' and 'Widget Code'.

The 'Widget UI' defines the widget configuration view, used for editing and the widget runtime view, or view mode. 

***Dashboard widget UI***

### Webhooks

To create webhooks:

1. Click on the **Webhooks** button from the main widget view to add a webhook. 

![Webhooks](/images/webhooks50.gif)

2. Use the slider to turn on **Enable Created Callback**, **Enable Updated Callback**, **Enable Deleted Callback** and **type in the URL** in each case to respond to process instance create, update and deleted events. 

   For example, choosing **Enable Created Callback** will enable a URL callback every time a process instance is updated. This results in a HTTP GET request with parameters instanceID={instanceID}, processName={processName} and eventType=created being issued to the give URL.

   **Note:** Callback has a timeout of 10 seconds.

3. Click on the **Help** button ![Help button](/images/webhookhelp.PNG) for clarification. 

4. Click on **OK** when done.
