# Form management #

Form management relates to who can edit and access forms. 

The key rules for working with forms are:

1. Forms are assignable - means that only a form assignee can edit a particular form. This can be a combination of users and groups.
2. Only form owners can edit a given form by default. Any other user with access to view the form will see it in read-only mode.

The rules above work together to determine if the form is in **edit mode** or **display mode**. Form designers have at their disposal [business rules](business-rules.md) such as *assign form*, *go to form* and *submit rule* to dynamically control the ability for end-users to edit a particular form or a section of a form.
