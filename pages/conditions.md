# Conditions #

Conditions allow you to make forms and dashboards fully dynamic. They are easy to configure in the Kianda platform, using natural language to create triggers for rule execution.

Conditions can be applied to [Tile](pages/tile.md), [List](pages/list.md) and [Chart](pages/chart.md) dashboard widgets.

   If a time-based field is chosen then a drop-down list of time-related operators become available, for example **Is Today**, **Is Between Days**, **Is Before Today** and so on.

7. Depending on the operator chosen, then a value field may be visible where you can either a) type in a value that you want to hone in on, or b) click into the field to drill down to a design field as found in a form. In the example below, we are looking for a particular value called 'completed' against the Common field, 'Status'.
